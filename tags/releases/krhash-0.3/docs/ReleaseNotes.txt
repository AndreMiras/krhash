= Release Notes =


== Implemented Hashing Algorithms ==
    - md2
    - sha0
    - lm
    - ntlm


== User Interface ==
    - import hashes from file
    - export cracked hashes to file
    - added checkboxes for setting up the charset on brute force
    - display current hash rate (cracked hash per second)


== Fixed Issues ==
    - fixed memory leak on brute force attack setup
    - fixed #1: total iteration precomputing
    - fixed #12: segfault when a hash provided in upper case is cracked
    - fixed #9: random segfault when cracking process goes to fast (e.g. big dictionary attack)
    - fixed custom user charset didn't work properly
    - fixed 0-byte issue on add/remove hash


== Misc ==
    - new cracking progress implementation
    - cracking settings saved (e.g. charset, path to dictionary)
    - added documentation
    - created "Hash Cracking Techniques" (http://code.google.com/p/krhash/wiki/HashCrackingTechniques) wiki page
    - created "Hashing Algorithms" (http://code.google.com/p/krhash/wiki/HashingAlgorithms) wiki page
