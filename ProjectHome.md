## Overview ##
KrHash is a graphical, multi-platform and generic hash cracker.

It's easy to use and let you crack a hash list.


KrHash is:

  * **graphical** -> easy to use

  * **cross-platform** -> can use it on Linux, BSD, Windows and Mac

  * **generic** -> easy to add some [hashing algorithms](HashingAlgorithms.md) and [cracking techniques](HashCrackingTechniques.md)


It's written in C++ using Qt framework.

KrHash is in an early stage of development but it is usable.
